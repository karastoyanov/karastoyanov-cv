# Profile
profile: |
  My name is Aleksandar Karastoyanov. I am born on 6th of November 1990 and currently I am located in
  Sofia, Bulgaria. My professional background is in Retail Marketing with almost 10 years of experience in a lead multi-national company,
  wide portfolio supplier of consumer good. However, in 2020 I've decided to pursue my long-time passion in technologies and change my career.
  I've started to develop my skills in that direction, mostly programming languages such as Python, JS, C++, Operating Systems, Databases, etc. and
  in 2022 successfully found myself as a Junior ServiceNow ITOM Consultant.
